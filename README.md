## Inaugral Project: Basic Labor Supply problem of Macroeconomic Model
 ### Import using numpy, scipy and matplotlib
 ### 1.1: Define obejctive function, define tax and define budget constraint, define consumer choice and define maximisation using optimize minimize scalar to get the results.
 ### 1.2: Usine range from question 2 plot the figure
 ### 1.3: Solve tax revenue
 ### 1.4 Calculate utility of consumption and labor price, also find optimal labor supply choice ~ Calculation is same as 1.1
